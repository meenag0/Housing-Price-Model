# Housing Price Prediction Model

This Jupyter notebook explores regression models to predict housing prices based on the California housing dataset. It includes data visualization, preprocessing, and model evaluation using multiple regression techniques.

## Project Overview

The `housing.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the end-to-end process of predicting housing prices using several regression models. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and building regression models.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Visual representations of the data to understand underlying patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques such as encoding categorical data and scaling features.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of various regression models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance of models is evaluated based on metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
